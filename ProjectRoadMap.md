- [x] 7. Plan goals for project. 
    - [ ] Have a button to select Windows or Mac host file.
    - [ ] Have an input for websites to be blocked.

    - [ ] Make steps user-friendly so they're easy to set up.
- [ ] 8. Start coding
    - [x] test examplecode1 and get it running, reporting on any issues and documenting how to make it work
        - [ ] cons: does not block every website in the URL file, does not manually unblock all websites       
    - [x] test examplecode2 and get it running, reporting on any issues and documenting how to make it work
        - [x] cons: did not have an unblock function
        - [x] pros: GUI setup
    - [x] test examplecode3 and get it running, reporting on any issues and documenting how to make it work
        - [x] cons: did not like the look of the GUI, had to edit the code itself to make it function
        - [x] pros: the block and unblock function, web add function
- [ ] 9. Update "How It Works" in the README file.
